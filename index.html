      <h2>About Kaneera</h2>
      <p>Kaneera by Nupur is more than a clothing label; it’s a celebration of heritage, 
        artistry, and timeless elegance. Every piece is thoughtfully designed to reflect 
        the rich tapestry of ethnic traditions, blending age-old techniques with contemporary silhouettes.
        Our collections are a dialogue between craft and soul — where every weave, embroidery, and texture 
        tells a story passed down through generations. We believe in empowering the wearer, letting them embrace 
        their identity while exuding confidence, grace, and individuality.
        Kaneera is for those who value authenticity, cherish the beauty of hand-crafted details, & see fashion as a canvas of culture and emotion.
        From festive ensembles to statement pieces, each creation carries the heart of tradition, reimagined for the modern wardrobe.
        With Kaneera by Nupur, you don’t just wear clothing — you experience a legacy, feel a connection, and radiate your heritage with every step..</p>
